They’re preferred by gamers and fast typists because the key press feels quick and uninterrupted. They are typically quiet, require little force variation, and offer a very predictable feel.",

        "desc": "Tactile switches have a noticeable bump partway through the key press. This bump acts as feedback to let you know the key has actuated, without needing to bottom out. They are great for both typing and general use because they provide physical confirmation with each keystroke while remaining relatively quiet.",
